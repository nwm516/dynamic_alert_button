# Dynamic Alert Buttons with Props assignment
This was an assignment for my Web Application Development class with the stated objective: "Extend the previous assignment (that being the Alert Buttons in React assignment): custom alert buttons React component to create a versatile toolbar with buttons that display different alert messages when clicked, demonstrating how to read and use props within event handlers."

# On viewing the Dynamic Alert Buttons with Props assignment
Within your IDE, if starting from absolute scratch, navigate to where you want to install the Custom Alert Buttons assignment project and you must run "npx create-react-app alert-button-toolbar" to initialize a React application project. Then, you must enter "cd alert-button-toolbar" to change directories into the project file. 
Once there, run "npm start" to begin the application server.

Adding the AlertButton.js, DynamicToolbar.js, and App.js from the repo to the "src" branch of the project should allow this project to run locally.
